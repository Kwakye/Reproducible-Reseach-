# 1. Assignment
The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events. You must use the database to answer the questions below and show the code for your entire analysis. Your analysis can consist of tables, figures, or other summaries. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

# 2. Synopsis
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains a public database for storm event. The data contains the type of storm event, details like location, date, estimates for damage to property as well as the number of human victims of the storm. In this report we investigate which type of events are the most harmful to the population and financially.

The conclusion is that the impact on humans, be it injuries or fatalities, isn't directly correlated to the ecomomic damage weather events cause.
